## Getting started 

1. Set git to rebase, not merge: `git config pull.rebase true` (we will all be working on main)
2. Go to excercises, and copy `template/` to `yourname/`, e.g. `jonas/` or `jonasbb/` (avoid spaces etc)
3. Get the links and credentials you need from Slack 
4. Commit stuff in your excercises-folder and see them deployed in the cluster, or use kubectl to do stuff. Have fun, we'll destroy cluster tomorrow :) 
5. Let me know what type of excercises you would want here. 

### How it works
Just go to excercises and **copy** the template to a folder with your name on it. 
Then, to start an excercise, simply remove the leading `_` and it will be deployed
